Description: decoding generic map values to structures and vice versa
 This library is most useful when decoding values from some data stream (JSON,
 Gob, etc.) where you don't _quite_ know the structure of the underlying data
 until you read a part of it. You can therefore read a `map[string]interface{}`
 and use this library to decode it into the proper underlying native Go
 structure.
